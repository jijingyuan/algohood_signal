### Flow Description

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Receive real-time market data
   - Data preprocessing and cleaning
   - Feature calculation and extraction

2. **Signal Generation**
   - Generate raw signals based on strategy rules
   - Apply technical indicators and models
   - Create trading recommendations

3. **Signal Filtering**
   - Risk control checks
   - Liquidity assessment
   - Signal strength validation

4. **Signal Distribution**
   - Multi-strategy distribution
   - Priority management
   - Real-time delivery

5. **Execution Feedback**
   - Execution status tracking
   - Performance evaluation
   - Strategy adjustment

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Dependencies

The project relies on the AlgoHood Utils package and other dependencies that will be installed automatically during setup.

## Quick Start

```python
from algoSignal.algoEngine import signalMgr, dataMgr

# Initialize Signal Manager
signal_manager = signalMgr.SignalManager()

# Initialize Data Manager
data_manager = dataMgr.DataManager()

# Process signals
signal_manager.process_signals()
```

## Configuration

Configure the system by modifying the configuration files in the `algoConfig` directory:
- `redisConfig.py` for Redis settings
- `loggerConfig.py` for logging preferences
